# Meeting of CSE Divison _Logic and Types_ 2018

- Date: 11-12 October 2018
- Place: [Salt & Sill](http://www.saltosill.se/)

## Travel

The outward journey is using the Tjörn express from Nils Ericsson Terminalen (09:00) to Klädesholmen östra (10:32).
We meet at Nils Ericsson Terminalen before 09:00; everyone will have to buy a bus ticket.
Do not be alarmed that Google Maps does not see this connection: after Aröd (10:16), the same bus continues as a new tour; this is not seen by Google Maps, but you can check the connection in [Västtrafik Reseplaneraren](https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/reseplaneraren/).

The return journey is via a chartered bus; tickets are unnecessary.
